                Directions:
                
                Begin by roasting the peanuts in a large pan over medium heat. Stir occasionally until the peanuts are golden brown and fragrant.
                
                Remove the peanuts from the heat and allow them to cool for a few minutes.
                
                Once the peanuts are cool enough to handle, place them in a food processor and pulse until they are finely ground.
                
                In a separate bowl, mix together the sugar, and salt until well combined.
                
                Add the ground peanuts to the sugar mixture and mix until everything is evenly distributed.
                
                Using your hands, shape the mixture into small, bite-sized pieces.
                
                Place the Paçoca pieces on a plate or tray and refrigerate for at least an hour to allow them to firm up.
                
                Serve and enjoy the delicious taste of Brazil's countryside in every bite!
